The correct version of front end Storebrix. Currently using copied tailwind stylesheet (index.css), and not run through the other github project

/Blog was created for housing html and css, but working html and css is located in root (EX: /storebrix/index.html ) 

To relocate where files are read from change "baseurl" field in config.yml
